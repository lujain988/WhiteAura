                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>
                            In recent years, the wedding industry has witnessed a
                            significant shift towards sustainability. Couples are
                            increasingly prioritizing eco-friendly practices to ensure
                            their special day leaves a positive impact on the planet. An
                            eco-friendly wedding not only reduces the environmental
                            footprint but also sets a meaningful precedent for guests.
                            This article serves as a blueprint for planning a sustainable
                            wedding, covering essential aspects from invitations to the
                            honeymoon.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Invitations: Going Digital or Using Recycled Paper</h2>
                        <p>
                            Traditional paper invitations contribute to deforestation and
                            waste. Instead, consider these eco-friendly alternatives:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong style="color: white">Digital Invitations:</strong>
                                Utilize online platforms to design and send invitations.
                                Websites like Paperless Post and Greenvelope offer beautiful
                                templates and tracking tools.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Recycled Paper:</strong> If you prefer physical
                                invitations, opt for recycled paper. Choose eco-friendly
                                inks and minimalistic designs to further reduce waste.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Venue: Embracing Natural Beauty</h2>
                        <p>
                            Choosing the right venue is crucial for an eco-friendly
                            wedding:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Outdoor Locations:</strong> Gardens, parks, and
                                beaches offer natural beauty that requires minimal
                                decoration.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Sustainable Venues:</strong> Some venues prioritize
                                sustainability by using renewable energy, recycling
                                programs, and eco-friendly practices.
                            </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Vintage or Second-hand Dresses:</strong> Consider
                                wearing a vintage dress or renting one to reduce textile
                                waste.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                        </ul>

                        <h2>Decorations: Minimalism and Reusability</h2>
                        <p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Locally Sourced Flowers:</strong> Use seasonal,
                                locally grown flowers to reduce carbon emissions from
                                transportation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Reusable Items:</strong> Opt for decorations that
                                can be reused or repurposed, such as potted plants, reusable
                                tableware, and fabric napkins.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Catering: Organic and Local</h2>

                                <strong>Vegetarian or Vegan Menu:</strong> Reducing meat
                                consumption can significantly lower the environmental
                                impact.
                            </li>
